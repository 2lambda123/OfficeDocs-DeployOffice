# Introduction to cloud update

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>- The information in this article applies only to organizations that received the notification to sign up for cloud update management in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center.
>- This article introduces cloud update, the recommended update management solution for Microsoft 365 Apps, highlighting its features, benefits, and the mapping of channels to profiles.

Take advantage of this premium offer by opting to cloud update, Microsoft's recommended update management solution for Microsoft 365 Apps. This innovative tool allows you to automatically deliver updates for specific users or Azure Active Directory groups, supporting Monthly Enterprise Channel, Current Channel, and Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel. As a qualifying tenant, you stand to gain a wealth of powerful controls, proactive insights, and the simplicity of a one-step onboarding process. With cloud update, you can update Microsoft 365 Apps while retaining your existing channel settings, giving you enhanced flexibility. This includes options to exclude specific devices or user groups, set update deadlines, or apply uniform update themes across your organization. Further, you'll have access to smart recommendations based on your tenant’s data, potentially identifying devices that could benefit from transitioning to more suitable update channels.


## Channel to Profile Mapping

Before onboarding to cloud update, view the current state of your tenant. For existing customers of the Monthly Enterprise Channel profiles, the tenant may be partially enabled on cloud, while new users have yet to onboard. The mapping of devices to profiles is as follows:

- Current Enterprise Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel devices will be mapped to current and monthly profiles, respectively.
- Semi-Annual (Preview) devices will be mapped to Wave 1 of the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel profile by default upon onboarding.
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel devices will be mapped to Wave 2 of the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel profile by default upon onboarding.

> [!NOTE] 
> All devices in the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel profile will get updated via the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel, regardless of the wave they are currently in.

## New Features and Benefits

Cloud update introduces a new set of powerful controls and proactive insights, along with a simple one-step onboarding process. It offers the flexibility to return to your previous management tools if cloud update doesn't work for your environment. Here are some of the new features available:

### Dashboard Cards

As soon as you sign in, you can view a consolidated update progress status at the tenant level.

### Updates Overview Page

This provides you with a snapshot view of update insights. It presents a comprehensive picture, including the overall percentage of updated devices, progress of updates per channel, trends in Updates & Security, issues and health signals, and Deployment Validation signals.

### Smart Recommendations

Act on smart recommendations based on valuable insights from the tenant's data. These insights include identifying devices that are out of support or pinpointing devices that could benefit from being transitioned to more suitable update channels based on their specific data.

### Tenant Settings

You have the ability to configure various controls at the tenant level. This includes options such as excluding specific devices or user groups, establishing exclusion time windows, setting update deadlines, or determining an update theme to be applied across the organization.

### Profiles Overview

Delve deeper into individual profiles, allowing a more thorough examination of progress, deployment validation, and signals. Take profile-level actions to address any concerns, such as pausing, rolling back, or skipping updates, depending on the profile you're in. Additionally, you can configure individual profiles, such as Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel profiles into waves as needed.

## Waitlist FAQs

- **What happens if I sign up for priority access to cloud update?**

    By signing up, your tenant is staged for new features while your existing environment remains unchanged. Your interest in cloud update is recorded and your tenant is added to the priority waitlist for the new feature experience. When the new features are ready, you’ll receive a notification that cloud update is available for your tenant.

- **If I sign up for access now, will I have the option to activate this feature when it becomes available?**

    Yes. Once you receive the notification that cloud update is available for your tenant, you can choose to enable it at that time.

- **What happens when I click “Sign up for access”?**

    The tenant you're signed into will be added to a priority waitlist for the new Cloud Update experience. You'll be notified through in-product notifications once this feature is available to try.

- **I have multiple tenants. Can I choose which ones will join the waitlist?**

    Yes. You need to sign into Microsoft 365 Apps admin center with a properly elevated account for each tenant you want on the waitlist.

- **If I sign up for access, will it impact the devices in my environment in any way?**

    No. Your environment won’t change, and your existing configuration will stay the same.

- **Can I remove my tenant(s) from the waitlist once I’ve signed up?**

    No. You can’t undo your choice once you’ve signed up, but you can choose to not activate this feature once it’s available.

- **When will Cloud Update be available through the waitlist program?**

    These features are in development. Expect to hear more through in-product notifications and communications. Keep an eye on the Microsoft 365 Roadmap.
