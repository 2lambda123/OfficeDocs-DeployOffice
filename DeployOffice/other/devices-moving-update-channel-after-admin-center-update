# Updates to the Microsoft 365 admin center may cause your devices to change update channels 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article applies to devices with Microsoft 365 that automatically moved to a new update channel due to a change in an internal Microsoft tool related to the **Microsoft 365 installation options** section in the Microsoft 365 admin center. 

With the goal of improving the experiences of all our customers, we're changing an internal Microsoft tool related to the **Microsoft 365 installation options** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This change allows you to manage more of your device and the frequency at which they receive **Feature updates** based on your update channel preference.

## How will this affect my devices?

Once your organization receives this update, you'll notice that some of your devices have automatically moved to another update channel. This is to be expected as those devices are now managed by the update channel selected on your **Microsoft 365 installation options** page. You may have devices that you don't want moved to another channel. For those devices, you can [manage how your devices receive updates]() with other admin tools.

> [!NOTE]
> - Before this change, we encourage you to review your **Feature updates** setting to ensure your devices are receiving updates based on your organizations needs. 
> - For more information, see [Choose how often to get feature update for Office](../manage-software-download-settings-office-365#choose-how-often-to-get-feature-updates-for-office.md)

It's important to note that not every device will receive updates based on the update channel selected in the **Microsoft 365 installation options** page if they are being managed by other admin tools in any of the following ways:
- Any device that is managed with a servicing profile in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center.
- Devices that are COM registered for Office management in Configuration Manager.
- All Intune managed Microsoft 365 deployments.
- Any device, regardless of the admin tool used to manage updates, with one of the following Microsoft 365 update related policies set:
- - Update channel
- - Update path
- - Target version

## Manage how your devices receive updates

To keep your devices on their existing update channel, you'll have to configure one of the following management options to set the update channel preference for your devices.

### Set an update policy

You can keep your devices on their current update channel by setting any of the following update channel policies through the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](../admincenter/overview-cloud-policy.md#steps-for-creating-a-policy-configuration), [Group Policy Objects](../change-update-channels.md#change-the-update-channel-with-group-policy), or [Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-office-policies).
- Update channel
- Update path
- Target version

### Servicing profile in Microsoft 365 Apps admin center

Servicing profiles let you automatically deliver monthly Office updates for specific users or groups. To apply a servicing profile, follow these steps.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com), choose **Servicing** in the left-hand navigation, and then choose **Monthly Enterprise**. 
2. Complete the setup wizard to apply the servicing profile to devices that meet the defined criteria. You have two options.

    - The first (and recommended) option will be to use **All Devices**, which will manage all eligible devices on your tenant. This choice will move the device from the channel it’s on, if that channel is selected in the device criteria, to Monthly Enterprise Channel. 
    - The second option is to use **Groups**, which allows you to specify an Azure Active Directory group to target the profile management. You can configure the servicing profile based on a device's servicing channel, available disk space, macro usage, and add-ins. To learn more about the requirements of and best practices around the **Groups** feature, refer to [How to set up the servicing profile with the “by Azure AD group” feature](../fieldnotes/adopt-servicing-profiles.md#how-to-set-up-the-servicing-profile-with-the-by-azure-ad-group-approach).

3. When you complete the wizard, the eligible devices will have the servicing profile applied within 2 hours.

For more information, see [Overview of servicing profile in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](../admincenter/servicing-profile.md)

###  Enable a COM object for Configuration Manager

For Configuration Manager to be able to manage Office updates, an Office COM object needs to be enabled on the computer where Office is installed. The Office COM object takes commands from Configuration Manager to download and install client updates.

You can enable the Office COM object by using client policy in Configuration Manager, Group Policy, or the Office Deployment Tool. If you use more than one method, the Group Policy setting determines the final configuration.

- [Method 1: Use client policy in Configuration Manager to enable updates from Configuration Manager](../manage-microsoft-365-apps-updates-configuration-manager.md#method-1-use-client-policy-in-configuration-manager-to-enable-updates-from-configuration-manager)
- [Method 2: Use Group Policy to enable updates from Configuration Manager](../manage-microsoft-365-apps-updates-configuration-manager.md#method-2-use-group-policy-to-enable-updates-from-configuration-manager)
- [Method 3: Use the Office Deployment Tool to enable updates from Configuration Manager](#method-3-use-the-office-deployment-tool-to-enable-updates-from-configuration-manager)

### Deploy Microsoft 365 Apps with Intune

Intune uses the [Office Deployment Tool](../overview-office-deployment-tool.md) to download and deploy Microsoft 365 Apps to your client computers using the [Office 365 CDN](../deploy-microsoft-365-apps-cloud.md). Reference the best practices outlined in [Managing Office 365 endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/managing-office-365-endpoints) to ensure that your network configuration permits clients to access the CDN directly rather than routing CDN traffic through central proxies to avoid introducing unnecessary latency.

For information on deploying Microsoft 365 Apps with Intune, see [Add Microsoft 365 Apps to Windows 10/11 devices with Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-office365)
