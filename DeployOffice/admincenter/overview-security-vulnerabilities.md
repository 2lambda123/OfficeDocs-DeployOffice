# Overview of the security vulnerabilities feature in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center

The Microsoft 365 Apps Admin Center provides comprehensive insight into the security posture of your devices. This understanding is important to maintaining an environment resistant to potential threats.

## Accumulated vulnerabilities

The Microsoft 365 Apps admin center displays both the accumulated vulnerabilities and the count of devices lagging in updates. A device that hasn't been updated misses at least one security patch, making it a potential risk.

## Schedule for security builds

All channels receive security builds on the second Tuesday of every month. For those using Monthly Enterprise Channel, this security build is incorporated as a part of the new monthly version. Every installation version receives a monthly security update for the duration of support for that channel. It's worth noting that Monthly Enterprise Channel has a support window of two months and will receive two security builds for every version.

## Security vulnerability details

In the security vulnerability details, each monthly security release is listed. This means that the device list, available when selecting the number of devices for a release, displays devices from every channel.

> [!NOTE]
> For a comprehensive rundown of vulnerabilities addressed per release, along with their specific build numbers, see [Release notes for Microsoft Office security updates](/officeupdates/microsoft365-apps-security-updates).

## Updating Devices

Admins should anticipate a span of up to a week to ensure all devices are updated to the latest security build. Devices lagging by more than two security builds should be prioritized for immediate attention.

To streamline this update process, while various tools and strategies are available, the recommended method for updating your devices is with a servicing profile. This enables automated cloud management of updates, ensuring timely security patches.
