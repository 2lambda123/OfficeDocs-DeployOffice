# Plan your enterprise deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps

Follow the steps in this article to choose how to deploy Microsoft 365 Apps and how to manage updates, and whether to deploy Microsoft 365 Apps from the cloud, with Configuration Manager or from a local source on your network. 

## Before you begin 

If you haven't already, complete the [assessment of your environment and infrastructure](assess-microsoft-365-apps.md). This assessment will help you make key decisions as part of planning your deployment.

## Step 1 - Choose how to deploy

First choose which deployment tool to use and whether to install from the cloud or from a local source on your network.

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** Microsoft recommends to deploy Microsoft 365 Apps from the cloud, using the portal or Microsoft Intune.

You can also manage your deployment from the Microsoft 365 portal and have your users install the Microsoft 365 Apps on their client devices [directly from the portal](https://www.microsoft365.com/). This method requires the least amount of administrative setup, but gives you less control over the deployment. You can, however, still define how frequently your users receive feature updates. For more details, see [Manage Microsoft 365 installation options in the Microsoft 365 admin center](manage-software-download-settings-office-365.md). This option requires that your users have local administrative rights on their client devices.

If this option is not feasible due to the number of devices you manager or because users don't have administrative permissions on their devices, you should consider using [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-office365) to deploy Microsoft 365 Apps. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/fA8lcnRXmkI) and the [Intune documentation](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-office365) to learn more about deploying the Microsoft 365 Apps this way.

You can also use Configuration Manager to deploy from local Distribution points. This will reduce the network load on your internet links. We recommend using the latest current branch release. 

For organizations that don't have Configuration Manager but still want to manage their deployment, we recommend using the Office Deployment Tool (ODT). You can use the ODT as a standalone tool or you can use it to download installation files that can be deployed using third-party software deployment tools. In either case, the ODT provides control over installation, updates, and settings. For more details, see [Overview of the Office Deployment Tool](overview-office-deployment-tool.md).

If you use the ODT and have the network capacity, we recommend deploying Microsoft 365 Apps from the cloud. Doing so will minimize your administrative overhead. If you don't have the network capacity to install on client devices from the cloud, you can use the ODT to download the installation files to a local source on your network and install from there. But this approach introduces more complexity into your deployment and is not recommended.


Choose how you want to deploy:

- **Self-install from the cloud:** Manage your deployment from the Microsoft 365 portal and have your users install the apps on their client devices directly from the portal.

- **Deploy from the cloud using Intune:** Manage your deployment through Intune and automate the configuration and installation of the Microsoft 365 Apps.

- **Deploy from a local source with Configuration Manager:** Manage your deployment with Configuration Manager, and download and deploy from distribution points on your network.

- **Deploy from the cloud with the Office Deployment Tool:** Manage your deployment with the ODT, and install on client devices directly from the Office CDN.
 
- **Deploy from a local source with the Office Deployment Tool:** Manage your deployment with the ODT, and download and deploy from a local source on your network. 

Many organizations will use a combination of these options for different users. For example, an organization might use Intune to deploy Microsoft 365 Apps to most of their users, but enable self-install for a small group of workers who aren't using managed devices.
 
## Step 2 - Choose how to manage updates

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** We recommend updating your client devices automatically.  You can define the frequency of the feature updates, but the updates occur without any administrative overhead. If you want to take more control and get additional insights into e.g. the progress of an update deployment, we recommend using [Servicing profiles](admincenter/servicing-profile.md).

We recommend updating your client devices automatically from the Office CDN. You can still control the frequency of the feature updates, as those settings are defined as part of the initial deployment, but the updates themselves occur without any additional tools or administrative overhead. In addition, the updates are automatically deployed over a number of days to conserve your network bandwidth.

You can also use Intune to apply additional policies, e.g. to set a deadline after how many days an update installation should be enforced. Review the [Intune documentation](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-update-office.md) on how to apply ADMX settings to devices.

The third, cloud-based option is to leverage [servicing profiles](admincenter/servicing-profile.md). It is a cloud-based update management solution for devices on Monthly Enterprise Channel. It includes features like advanced monitoring, reporting, enforcing, staggering, and rolling back devices.

If you need to distribute updates from an on-prem source, you can do so with Configuration Manager by downloading the updates and deploying them from distribution points. If you use a previous version of Configuration Manager, we recommend you upgrade to the current branch.

If you don't have Configuration Manager, you can use the ODT to download updates to a local source on your network and deploy them from there. This option requires the most administrative overhead, as you'll need to manage update packages for different update channels, architectures, and platforms. We suggest this option only when your network capacity is too limited to update from the cloud and other solutions are not available.

Choose how to manage updates:

- **Update automatically:** Client devices are automatically updated directly from the Office CDN based on the update channel you define as part of the initial deployment.  

- **Manage updates with Intune:** Use Intune to set policies on devices which control how and when those should get updates from the cloud. 

- **Manage updates with Servicing profiles:** When using the Monthly Enterprise Channel, profiles gives you the most comprohensive toolset to manage updates from the cloud. 

- **Manage updates with Configuration Manager:**  Updates are downloaded and deployed to client devices by Configuration Manager. 

- **Manage updates with the Office Deployment Tool:** Updates are downloaded to a local source by the ODT and then installed on client devices. 
    
As with the initial deployment, organizations can use a combination of these options for different users.

For more information, see [Choose how to deliver updates for the Microsoft 365 Apps](./fieldnotes/choose-how-to-deliver-updates.md).

## Step 3 - Choose your update channels

With Microsoft 365 Apps, you can control how frequently your users receive feature updates to their applications. To do so, you choose an update channel for your users:

- **Current Channel:** Provides users with the latest features as soon as they're ready, but on no set schedule.

- **Monthly Enterprise Channel:** Provides users with the latest features once a month and on a predictable schedule (the second Tuesday of the month)

- **Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel:** Provides users a roll-up of features every six months, in January and July.

> [!NOTE]
> The "[Explained - Microsoft 365 Apps Update Channels](https://youtu.be/eNn4PDkmo7s)" video gives you a complete overview of all update channels.

We recommend Current Channel, because it provides your users with the newest features as soon as they're ready. If you need additional predictability of when new features are released, we recommend Monthly Enterprise Channel with a [servicing profile](./admincenter/servicing-profile.md). By using a servicing profile, youâ€™ll automatically deliver monthly Microsoft 365 Apps updates for specific users or groups in waves, limiting the impact on your network. In those cases where you've selected devices that require extensive testing before receiving new features, we recommend Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel.

All the update channels will receive updates for security and non-security issues when needed. These updates usually occur on the second Tuesday of the month.

For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps](overview-update-channels.md).

To preview or test new updates before deploying them to your entire organization, you can deploy two update channels. For example, if you're using Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel:

- Deploy Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) to a targeted group of representative users who can pilot new features of Office. The users should include people from business groups across the organization and their client devices should include the architectures in your organization (32-bit and 64-bit), any significant differences in hardware and device drivers, as well as any critical line-of-business applications, add-ins, and macros. This group receives feature updates four months ahead of the rest of your organization. We recommend using the same group of users you defined in the [assessment phase](assess-microsoft-365-apps.md). 

- Deploy Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel to the remaining users in your organization. They receive feature updates every six months, four months after the users with Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview).

You could take a similar approach with Current Channel (Preview) and Current Channel. In that scenario, users with Current Channel usually receive feature updates just a few weeks after the users with Current Channel (Preview).

 
## Step 4 - Define your source files

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** Build separate Office installation packages for the different architectures and update channels you require. In each installation package, include all the required languages and applications, including the core Office applications and, if needed, Visio and Project. For additional languages, you can make them available for user installation or deploy them separately after the initial deployment.

When deploying Office, you create an installation package of the source files used to install Office. The source files are different for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Office and are different for each of the update channels. Because of this, you'll likely need to create multiple installation packages to support the different architectures and update requirements in your organization. For example, to deploy to two update channels and both architectures, you create four packages: 

- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel for 32-bit 
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel for 64-bit
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) for 32-bit
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) for 64-bit

You can also create separate packages based on different languages, Office applications, or installation settings, but we don't recommend it. Instead, we recommend including all the Office applications and all the languages your organization requires in each of your installation packages. Later, when you deploy the packages to different groups of client devices, you can specify which language and Office applications are actually installed.

To package the languages, we recommend identifying required languages in each region. You can deploy these languages directly as part of the first installation of Office. You can also install the language that matches the operating system of the client device. For more details, see [Install the same languages as the operating system](overview-deploying-languages-microsoft-365-apps.md#install-the-same-languages-as-the-operating-system).  

After you've deployed Office with the required languages, you can install additional language accessory packs at any time by choosing one of the following:

- Have your users download and install the language accessory packs that they need from the Office 365 portal (requires local administrator permissions).
- Use Configuration Manager or the Office Deployment Tool to deploy the appropriate language accessory packs to your users.

For more details, see [Overview of deploying languages for Microsoft 365 Apps](overview-deploying-languages-microsoft-365-apps.md).

For details on which architecture to choose, see [Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2dee7807-8f95-4d0c-b5fe-6c6f49b8d261).

If you have the subscription versions of the Project and Visio desktop apps, continue to use those. If you have the 2013 versions of Project and Visio, you can either upgrade to the subscription versions or keep using the 2013 versions side-by-side with Microsoft 365 Apps. If you have the 2016 MSI version of Project or Visio, you should [use the Office Deployment Tool to install volume licensed editions of Visio 2016 and Project 2016](use-the-office-deployment-tool-to-install-volume-licensed-editions-of-visio-2016.md).

## Step 5 - Define your deployment groups

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** Define deployment groups to deploy the appropriate architectures, update channels, languages, and applications to your client devices. If multiple deployment groups share the same architecture and update channel, use the same installation package to install Office.

When deploying Office, you can install different versions of Office for different groups of users. In addition to the architecture and update channel, you can include or exclude specific applications, choose languages, and define the installation experience. Each group of users is a separate deployment group. If you use Configuration Manager, you define the settings for these deployment groups as part of the deployment wizard. If you use the ODT, you define the settings in a configuration file. 

Note that you can use the same installation package to deploy different configurations of Office to different groups. For example, you can create an installation package that includes the following:

- 32-bit version of Microsoft 365 Apps
- English, Japanese, and German
- Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel

This single installation package can then be used to deploy to multiple deployment groups:

- Group 1 receives the Office apps in English
- Group 2 receives the Office apps in all three languages
- Group 3 receives the Office apps in English, but without Publisher

By reusing installation packages for different deployment groups, you can save administrative costs and conserve network bandwidth.

## Step 6 - Plan your upgrade from existing versions of Office 

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** Before installing Microsoft 365 Apps, remove any existing versions of Office. 

Before installing Microsoft 365 Apps, we recommend removing any existing versions of Office. Microsoft supports installing Microsoft 365 Apps alongside the most recent previous version of the Office suite, but we don't recommend it. If you need to have two versions of Office on the same computer, we recommend that you keep only the necessary earlier applications and that you plan to transition to using only Microsoft 365 Apps when possible. To verify the supported versions to be installed alongside Microsoft 365 Apps, refer to [Supported scenarios for installing different versions of Office, Project, and Visio on the same computer](install-different-office-visio-and-project-versions-on-the-same-computer.md).

To help you remove prior versions of Office that use Windows Installer (MSI) as the installation technology, you can use the Office Deployment Tool and specify the RemoveMSI element to automate the removal with your Microsoft 365 Apps deployment package. For details see [Remove existing MSI versions of Office when upgrading to Microsoft 365 Apps](upgrade-from-msi-version.md).

## Step 7 - Plan for shared computers (optional)

> [!NOTE]
> **Best practice:** For shared computer scenarios, such as VDI, enable shared computer activation when deploying Microsoft 365 Apps.

If your organization has a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) implementation, or you have users that share workstations (for example, shift workers), you need to enable shared computer activation for those devices when you deploy Microsoft 365 Apps. 

With shared computer activation enabled, any user that has been assigned a Microsoft 365 Apps license can log on to the computer and use the Office apps, such as Word or Excel. For more details, see [Overview of shared computer activation for Microsoft 365 Apps](overview-shared-computer-activation.md).
