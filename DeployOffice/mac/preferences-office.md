# Set suite-wide preferences for Office for Mac

***Applies to:*** *Word for Mac, Excel for Mac, PowerPoint for Mac, Outlook for Mac, Office LTSC for Mac 2021, Office 2019 for Mac*

As an IT admin, you may want to provide Mac users in your organization with a standard set of preferences for Office in either of the following ways:

- Set a default preference, which users can change.
- Force a particular preference, which users canâ€™t change.

The following preferences can be used to simplify account setup for Microsoft 365 (or Office 365) and support a streamlined user experience.

These keys are CFPreferences-compatible, which means that it can be set by using enterprise management software for Mac, such as Jamf Pro.

The following list shows the preferences that are covered in this article:

- [Automatically sign in and suppress welcome dialogs](#automatically-sign-in-and-suppress-welcome-dialogs)
